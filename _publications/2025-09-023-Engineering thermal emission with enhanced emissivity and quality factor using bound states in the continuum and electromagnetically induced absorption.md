excerpt: 'We demonstrate a Lieb-lattice metasurface design that merges multiple toroidal-dipole bound states in the continuum (BICs) at the Γ point without needing up-down symmetry, achieving out-of-plane loss suppression and a super high quality factor (~10⁵) via using a surrounding lateral band-gap mirror'

Metal-based thermal metasurfaces exhibit stable spectral characteristics under temperature fluctuations, in contrast to more traditional gray- and near black-bodies, as well as some dielectric metasurfaces, whose emission spectra shift with changing temperatures. However, they often suffer from limited quality (Q) factors due to significant non-radiative ohmic losses. In this study, we address the challenge of achieving high emissivity and Q-factors in metal-based thermal emitters. By leveraging the coupling of three surface lattice resonances that support bound states in the continuum and electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA), we design a metal-based thermal metasurface with a near-unity emissivity (0.96) and a Q factor as high as 320 through simulations. Experimental validation yields an emissivity of 0.82 and a Q factor of 202, representing an approximately five-fold improvement in the experimentally measured Q factor compared to the state-of-the-art metal-based thermal metasurfaces. Our work offers a promising approach for developing efficient, narrow-band, directional thermal emitters with stable emission spectra across a wide temperature range.
