This paper investigates high-density resistive random access memory (RRAM) arrays using a multiphysics framework with parallel computing, highlighting how coupled electrical, thermal, and reliability effects can be modeled efficiently. It demonstrates that large-scale simulation accelerates design optimization and provides insights into performance and integration challenges for future memory technologies.
