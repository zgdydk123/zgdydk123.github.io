excerpt: 'We demonstrate a Lieb-lattice metasurface design that merges multiple toroidal-dipole bound states in the continuum (BICs) at the Γ point without needing up-down symmetry, achieving out-of-plane loss suppression and a super high quality factor (~10⁵) via using a surrounding lateral band-gap mirror'

This paper proposed a novel mechanism for merging BICs at the Γ point, even in the absence of up-down symmetry. To accomplish this, we utilize a toroidal dipole BIC implemented in a Lieb lattice metasurface. These accidental BICs, located away from the Γ point can stably exist within a wide range of environment refractive indices. By incorporating a lateral band gap mirror made of a Lieb lattice, the size of the BIC metasurface can be effectively reduced without compromising the Q factor. The Lieb lattice band gap mirror prevents in-plane radiation, ensuring the preservation of high Q factors. Our discovery offers substantial potential for integrating BICs into various applications, including nanolasers, optical trapping, biosensors, and quantum computing. This is particularly pertinent in scenarios where high-Q miniaturized devices are sought. Furthermore, due to the inherent topological nature of BICs, our approach provides robustness, paving the way for further enhancing the performance of optoelectronic devices.
