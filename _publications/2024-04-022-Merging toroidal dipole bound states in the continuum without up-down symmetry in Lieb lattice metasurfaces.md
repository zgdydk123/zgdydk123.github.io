excerpt: 'We demonstrate a Lieb-lattice metasurface design that merges multiple toroidal-dipole bound states in the continuum (BICs) at the Γ point without needing up-down symmetry, achieving out-of-plane loss suppression and a super high quality factor (~10⁵) via using a surrounding lateral band-gap mirror'
