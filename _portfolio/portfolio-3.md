Milk-derived extracellular vesicles (mEVs) are actively investigated for their
bioavailability, low immunogenicity, high-biostability, traversing gastrointestinal barriers
and serves as promising drug delivery vehicles for oral administration. However, mEVs
intrinsic heterogeneity in size and cargo poses significant challenges for understanding
their structural, biochemical, physiological roles. To address this, novel label-free
approaches for trapping and imaging mEVs are essential. We report a complete
nanotweezer platform that enables stable trapping, AI-assisted automated
characterization, and label-free imaging of mEVs using interferometric scattering
microscopy (ISCAT). Our platform employs an electrohydrodynamic tweezer featuring a
15 μm diameter hole array on a thin gold film, which generates an array of AC electro-
osmotic flows for parallel and rapid trapping of nanoparticles. Utilizing high fidelity purified
mEVs devoid of casein micelles, we integrated AI-assisted particle tracking to analyze
the Brownian motion of vesicles released from traps by switching off the AC field. This
allows precise characterization of diffusion dynamics, enabling size estimation based on
Einstein’s diffusion equation. This nanotweezer and label-free imaging approach,
combined with AI-assisted tracking, offers a powerful tool for real-time, non-perturbative
analysis of milk-derived extracellular vesicles and nanoparticles, advancing the
understanding of their biological functions and therapeutic potential.
