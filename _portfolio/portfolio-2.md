A periodic metal ring array supports three coupled surface lattice resonances, yielding two bound states in the continuum and a standing-wave mode associated with the Rayleigh anomaly (0, Â±1). The structure achieves record-high quality factors (202) and emissivity (0.8) experimentally, offering thermally stable, narrowband mid-infrared emission ideal for high-precision gas sensing applications.
